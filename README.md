# Hello-world

Hi reader,

My name is Justin Latos... and I'm taking my first steps in learning to code.  I've chosen python [smiling].  I hope to commit a few years to learning it, then find a cool job with it.

I currently work as a mental health counsellor.  I love the work, but the pay is quite poor.  I've found a woman I love, and would like to start a family... and that requires a decent income.  Will this humble start help me in that?  

Stay tuned...

Thanks for reading,

Justin
